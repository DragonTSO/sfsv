Since then, we have noticed that all of the custom heads within the Slimefun guide and Slimefun as a whole, are just Steve/non-textured heads. After discussing within #bug-discussions, it was mentioned that another plugin had this same issue; Vehicles. The plugin devs found that this started with paper build [#247.](https://github.com/PaperMC/paper/commit/acc6d012b0bb7c2e781c3506a2f598adea460ae8)\r\n\r\nFrom my testing, this is 100% true. Build 246 of Paper it works, build 247, all the player heads no longer have textures. \r\n\r\nHere is some additional information to what I have found investigating:\r\n_Note: Some of this might be completely useless but since I've spent hours, I will be listing everything I have found._\r\n- 1.20.2 has changed the way skulls/player heads are handled. Apparently, they now need both a UUID and NAME to be specified. \r\n- When using Minecraft's give command to give myself my own player head, this is the output of `/paper dumpitem`:\r\n`minecraft:player_head{SkullOwner:{Id:[I;-1413460822,-750763633,-1892653176,-501695085],Name:\"iiLucky_\",Properties:{textures:[{Signature:\"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\",Value:\"ewogICJ0aW1lc3RhbXAiIDogMTY5OTkzOTYyMDE3OSwKICAicHJvZmlsZUlkIiA6ICJhYmMwNGNhYWQzNDA0MThmOGYzMDY3ODhlMjE4YmQ5MyIsCiAgInByb2ZpbGVOYW1lIiA6ICJpaUx1Y2t5XyIsCiAgInNpZ25hdHVyZVJlcXVpcmVkIiA6IHRydWUsCiAgInRleHR1cmVzIiA6IHsKICAgICJTS0lOIiA6IHsKICAgICAgInVybCIgOiAiaHR0cDovL3RleHR1cmVzLm1pbmVjcmFmdC5uZXQvdGV4dHVyZS9iOGJkOTJhZDk3ZjJhMjc2NDMwZDI4ZTNjZTkzOTAwNjI2M2RmMjRiN2ZmMzZhM2E3NWMwNmY3YThkMDllOTk4IgogICAgfQogIH0KfQ==\"}]}}}`\r\nCommand:\r\n`/minecraft:give iiLucky_ minecraft:player_head{SkullOwner:iiLucky_}`\r\n\r\nCompared to the radiant backpack:\r\n`minecraft:player_head{PublicBukkitValues:{\"slimefun:slimefun_item\":\"RADIANT_BACKPACK\"},SkullOwner:{Id:[I;-198377739,1921335127,-1218858788,793121819],Name:\"CS-CoreLib\"},display:{Lore:['{\"text\":\"\"}','{\"extra\":[{\"bold\":false,\"italic\":false,\"underlined\":false,\"strikethrough\":false,\"obfuscated\":false,\"color\":\"gray\",\"text\":\"Size: \"},{\"italic\":false,\"color\":\"yellow\",\"text\":\"54 (Double chest)\"}],\"text\":\"\"}','{\"extra\":[{\"bold\":false,\"italic\":false,\"underlined\":false,\"strikethrough\":false,\"obfuscated\":false,\"color\":\"gray\",\"text\":\"ID: <ID>\"}],\"text\":\"\"}','{\"text\":\"\"}','{\"extra\":[{\"bold\":false,\"italic\":false,\"underlined\":false,\"strikethrough\":false,\"obfuscated\":false,\"color\":\"yellow\",\"text\":\"Right Click\"},{\"italic\":false,\"color\":\"gray\",\"text\":\" to open\"}],\"text\":\"\"}'],Name:'{\"extra\":[{\"bold\":false,\"italic\":false,\"underlined\":false,\"strikethrough\":false,\"obfuscated\":false,\"color\":\"yellow\",\"text\":\"Radiant Backpack\"}],\"text\":\"\"}'}}`\r\n\r\nIt seems later version might depend on the \"Properties:{textures:\" within the NBT?\r\n\r\n- Paper build 246 to 247 is an Updated Upstream commit outlined here: https://github.com/PaperMC/Paper/pull/9861.

Have two signed books (A and B).\r\n2. Place these blocks (listed from left to right, but placement order does not matter, appaerently):\r\n   - Chest,\r\n   - Cargo Node (Input),\r\n   - Cargo Manager\r\n   - Cargo Node (Output),\r\n   - Chest.\r\n 3. Set the Cargo Node (Input) type to Blacklist.\r\n 4. Insert the book to be copied (A) into the right (output) chest.\r\n 5. Insert the other book (B) into the left (input) chest.\r\n 6. In the right chest you will have the copied book (A) two times.\r\n\r\nThe same applies to player heads.\r\n\r\nAlso it works for higher quantities of items: for example, if you were to fill the right chest with the A books, and then proceed to insert some B books into the left chest, the item stacks in the right chest will all get eventually filled up.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if you would only have 1 A book in the right chest and you were to put 17 B books into the left chest, you would end up with 16 A books and 2 B books in the right chest. So the issue is clearly **linked to incomplete item stacks**.\r\n\r\n### üí° Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nI would expect the B book to transfer to the right (output) chest, instead of getting another A book.\r\n\r\n### üì∑ Screenshots / Videos\r\n\r\nSee the bug reproduction process screencap: https://ctrlv.tv/ZLMh\r\n\r\n### üìú Server Log\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### üìÇ `/error-reports/` folder\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### üíª Server Software\r\n\r\nPaper\r\n\r\n### üéÆ Minecraft Version\r\n\r\n1.17.x\r\n\r\n### ‚≠ê Slimefun version\r\n\r\nTested on:\r\n```\r\nThis Server uses the following setup of Slimefun:\r\nPaper git-Paper-411 (MC: 1.17.1)\r\nSlimefun RC -

This applies to all the types [listed on the wiki](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Recipe#crafting_special_*). This renders automating the crafting of items like firework rockets or dyed shulker boxes impossible.\n\n### üìë Reproduction Steps\n\n1. Create a server running just Slimefun on Paper.\r\n2. Obtain an Vanilla Auto Crafter.\r\n3. Crouch + Right Click with one of the items listed under the special crafting category.\r\n4. The Vanilla Auto Crafter will say no recipe for the item can be found.\n\n### üí° Expected Behavior\n\nThe Vanilla Auto Crafter will attempt to find a recipe within reason for a given item. This would be a recipe of gunpowder and paper for a flight duration 1 explosion-less firework rocket.\n\n### üì∑ Screenshots / Videos\n\n[Larger than 10mb, put on Youtube.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pRBggUAJY)\n\n### üìú Server Log\n\nhttps://pastebin.com/PpvkMTfh\n\n### üìÇ `/error-reports/` folder\n\n_No response_\n\n### üíª Server Software\n\nPaper\n\n### üéÆ Minecraft Version\n\n1.20.x\n\n### ‚≠ê Slimefun version\n\n![image](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/assets/98472539/0d9803f5-ef45-4b36-8c54-45e2887f3446)\r\n\n\n### üß≠ Other plugins\n\n_No response_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4019/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4019/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4018","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4018/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4018/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4018/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/4018","id":1981405244,"node_id":"PR_kwDOATMVe85ezymk","number":4018,"title":"Add Horizontal Offset support to Holograms","user":{"login":"test137E29B","id":37277599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3Mjc3NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37277599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/test137E29B","html_url":"https://github.com/test137E29B","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/test137E29B/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/test137E29B/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/test137E29B/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/test137E29B/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/test137E29B/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/test137E29B/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/test137E29B/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/test137E29B/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/test137E29B/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":2683831333,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjgzODMxMzMz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/labels/%F0%9F%8E%88%20Feature","name":"üéà Feature","color":"C8E3F2","default":false,"description":"This Pull Request adds a new feature."}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2023-11-07T13:48:22Z","updated_at":"2023-11-07T15:41:14Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pulls/4018","html_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/4018","diff_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/4018.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/4018.patch","merged_at":null},"body":"## Description\r\n<!-- Please explain why you are making this pull request. -->\r\n<!-- Start writing below this line -->\r\nHologram projectors are really nice things to use, but they lack horizontal offset support meaning any design without a central block annoyingly has an offset hologram.

When there is no oil, this causes the output slots currently to fill with the bucket, which then gets pulled into the storage system again. However, once the bucket goes into the oil pump, there's room in the storage for another to be crafted and as such it's crafted and stored. This means there's now 1 too many buckets to be stored. The same happens again as an oil can fit in the output and eventually you get both output slots filled with buckets with no storage free for them at all. This then prevents the oil pump from working entirely until they're cleaned out.\r\n\r\n## Proposed changes\r\nI propose adding a cooldown to the oil pump when it finds no resource, such that it does not move the bucket but instead for  5 seconds will not even bother checking the recipes, resource supplies, or anything else. It simply returns fast (or fast enough). This means we no longer need to move the bucket to the output slot for lag prevention (even though this doesn't actually prevent lag really from what I can see, because there will always be more buckets in the input getting ticked).\r\n\r\n## Related Issues (if applicable)\r\n<!-- Please tag any Issues related to your Pull Request -->\r\n<!-- Syntax: \"Resolves #000\" -->\r\n<!-- Start writing below this line -->\r\nNone\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] I have fully tested the proposed changes and promise that they will not break everything into chaos.\r\n- [x] I have also tested the proposed changes in combination with various popular addons and can confirm my changes do not break them.\r\n- [x] I have made sure that the proposed changes do not break compatibility across the supported Minecraft versions (1.16.* - 1.20.*).\r\n- [x] I followed the existing code standards and didn't mess up the formatting.\r\n- [x] I did my best to add documentation to any public classes or methods I added.\r\n- [x] I have added `Nonnull` and `Nullable` annotations to my methods to indicate their behaviour for null values\r\n- [ ] I added sufficient Unit Tests to cover my code.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4010/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4010/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4008","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4008/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4008/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4008/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4008","id":1964952228,"node_id":"I_kwDOATMVe851Hsqk","number":4008,"title":"IA ores+ SF Explosive Pickaxe duplication","user":{"login":"dipolo12q","id":57011274,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MDExMjc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57011274?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dipolo12q","html_url":"https://github.com/dipolo12q","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dipolo12q/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dipolo12q/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dipolo12q/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dipolo12q/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dipolo12q/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dipolo12q/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dipolo12q/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dipolo12q/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dipolo12q/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":499484638,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0OTk0ODQ2Mzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/labels/%F0%9F%90%9E%20Bug%20Report","name":"üêû Bug Report","color":"d73f1f","default":false,"description":"A bug that needs to be fixed."},{"id":2629433731,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjI5NDMzNzMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/labels/%F0%9F%8E%AF%20Needs%20testing","name":"üéØ Needs testing","color":"41CF62","default":false,"description":"This Issue needs to be tested by our team to see if it can be reproduced."}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2023-10-27T07:41:24Z","updated_at":"2023-11-08T09:11:00Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"### ‚ùó Checklist\n\n- [X] I am using the official english version of Slimefun and did not modify the jar.\n- [X] I am using an up to date \"DEV\" (not \"RC\") version of Slimefun.\n- [X] I am aware that issues related to Slimefun addons need to be reported on their bug trackers and not here.\n- [X] I searched for similar open issues and could not find an existing bug report on this.\n\n### üìç Description\n\nDuplication Bug when mine items adder ores with explosive pickaxe.

Description\r\nI have recently run into an issue where a world, when created quickly enough after deletion of a world with the same name, will not store data. I have tested this extensively and narrowed the issue down to [this](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/blob/master/src/main/java/io/github/thebusybiscuit/slimefun4/implementation/tasks/TickerTask.java#L102) ticker code and [this](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/blob/master/src/main/java/me/mrCookieSlime/Slimefun/api/BlockStorage.java#L116) check for the world's existence. Since the ticker code only runs every half second, it does not remove the world from the registry until up to a Slimefun tick later and therefore causes issues in the constructor.\r\n\r\nAn easy way to recreate this issue is to delete a world and immediately create a new one with the same name.\r\n\r\nFull credits go to @gecko10000 for some reason (my git skills most likely) his PR got closed while i tried to update it.\r\n\r\n## Proposed changes\r\nThis PR changes the registry to use UUIDs instead of the world names themselves. This _does not_ affect the storage location in files and therefore these are not breaking changes.\r\n\r\nThis may not be the ideal way to do it; it may be better to remove the world from the registry [here](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/blob/master/src/main/java/io/github/thebusybiscuit/slimefun4/implementation/listeners/WorldListener.java#L28) instead.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues (if applicable)\r\nNo issue opened\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n<!-- Here is a little checklist you can follow. -->\r\n<!-- Click on these checkboxes after you created the pull request. -->\r\n<!-- Don't worry, these are not requirements.

After these problems rose, I saw in the console a message that states \"[20:15:08 ERROR]: [Slimefun] An Exception was caught while ticking the Block Tickers Task for Slimefun vDEV - 1068 (git cab97b1a)\r\njava.lang.IllegalStateException: World \"Teknocraft S3.5\" seems to have been deleted.

If you have Slimefun item that is placable (+more, tried it with machines, cargo, solar panels, backpacks) in your main hand, it plants a seed which after destroying drops the item that was in your hand. I asked Vehicles support and they found out that the error causing it is probably line 80. I am sending some messages from him:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19331474/218342787-f9cf8547-8f93-4959-80eb-c95802684c0c.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19331474/218342790-c80efdfa-cc01-4c27-b1b0-7468d9eac6c2.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19331474/218342799-2b04763a-0e3a-4cbe-b8e5-3f058abae69f.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19331474/218342803-e8a56951-59bb-4bc9-9e46-d71a83d96bee.png)\r\n\r\n(Server is running on Waterfall - Yatopia)\n\n### üìë Reproduction Steps\n\n1. Ride a tractor\r\n2. Put in seeds\r\n3. Put the Slimefun item in your main hand\r\n4. Ride over farmland\r\n5. Destroy the seed (doesn‚Äôt have to be grown)\n\n### üí° Expected Behavior\n\nIt shouldn‚Äôt interfere with what you are planting, it should plant the item that is in the vehicle trunk.\n\n### üì∑

Description\n\nSome days ago someone reported that they can't craft an [ElectricSpawner](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/ElectricSpawners).\r\n\r\nBoomer and I checked on this and found out that having extra NBT Tags in this case we will focused on `CustomModelData`, made the item not accepted by the recipe.\r\n\r\nI believe this is a Core Slimefun issue that is why I'm posting it here rather on [ElectricSpawners Issue](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/ElectricSpawners/issues)\r\n\r\nThe item that affects with issue that we tested:\r\n- Reinforced Spawners\r\n- All vanilla item (I think this deserve they own issue, let me know if you guys need me to open one, but I will just explain it briefly below)\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Details</summary>\r\n\r\nAll vanilla items with extra NBT Tags will not be recognized by Slimefun as a valid item and can't craft the item.\r\nVideo: https://youtu.be/V2JIAVB3-JA\r\n\r\n</details>\n\n### üìë Reproduction Steps\n\n1. Open `item-models.yml`\r\n2. Add a value under `REINFORCED_SPAWNER`. (I'll use 1)\r\n3. Start the server\r\n4. Obtain yourself a spawner (In the video I'll be using vanilla generated spawner, spawned spawner, and soul jars)\r\n5. Repair the spawner\r\n6. Try to craft it to their ElectricSpawner type\r\n7. You can't\n\n### üí° Expected Behavior\n\nYou should be able to craft it\n\n### üì∑ Screenshots / Videos\n\nThe video is a little bit long, but there is timestamps to guide

The main problem I need to fix, is actually fact that players are able to enchant mmoitems witch blocked use in enchanting tables or anvils in sf autoenchanters. in. My items are blocked against enchanting but in sf you can simply bypass it. I know there's a way to add blocked lore. But what about old items without that lore? A lot of of my players using items without this lore.\r\n\r\nSo what I need to add ?\r\nEasily check stats from mmoitem and if it has blocked using in crafting, enchanting.., it won't be possible to upgrade this item. This will be probably better than using lores, because it will apply to all items no matter how old those items are.\r\n\r\nLet me know, if it is possible, thanks and have a good day!\r\n\r\n### üìë Reproduction Steps\r\n\r\nCreate an mmoitem and block it's interaction in enchanting tables/anvils.\r\nAdd this item to slimefun autoenchanter.\r\nYou can add this item there.\r\n\r\n### üí° Expected

üìî Introduction\r\nOver the last few months and years you all have often requested for us to be more open in regards to upcoming changes.\r\nSo we decided its time to finally release a proper roadmap.\r\nNote here that this roadmap will never be complete and final, we may add or change some goals from time to time and we will refrain from setting a release date for things until absolutely certain.\r\n\r\nThis simply serves as a rough guide for you to see what changes you can be excited about.\r\nMany of those changes will likely be of technical nature though, so they may not be as exciting or intesting at first.\r\n\r\nAlso, we aren't actively looking for pull requests towards these goals unless explicitly requested.\r\nIf you wish to make a pull request, choose any open issue or approved suggestion and you are more than welcome :heart:\r\nThese changes however are mainly targeted towards the core team.\r\n\r\n## ‚≠ê Upcoming changes\r\nSome of these milestones will have a date assigned to them.\r\nBut the majority of milestones are still to far away to even have a date ready here.\r\nThose are marked as *TBD* (to be decided).\r\n\r\n| Symbol | Type of change |\r\n| :---: | :------- |\r\n| üîß | Technical change / API |\r\n| üéà | New Features |\r\n| üí° | Performance improvements |\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Older changes</summary>\r\n\r\n### üîß ~~(September 3rd - 6th 2021) API relocation~~ - **DONE**\r\nThe first upcoming change is a major relocation of some of our classes to unify some packages, get rid of old classpaths and to follow the general conventions. You can read more about this here: https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/3139\r\n\r\n### üîß ~~(Q3 2022) Updating to Java 16~~\r\nSlimefun will update to Java 16.\r\nYou can see the progress here: https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/3602\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### üéà(Q3 2022) New sound-system\r\nSoon we will allow server owners to fully configure any sound in this plugin.\r\nThis will also work with custom sounds from resource packs. Additionally you can change the pitch and volume of any sound or even mute it.\r\nYou can see the progress here: https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/2844\r\n\r\n### üîß (2023) Inventory system rewrite\r\nNext up is a rewrite for our inventory-system. The API is very rusty and aged. We don't have an ETA yet, perhaps closely after or along with the aforementioned API relocation.\r\nThe new system will be much more flexible and easier to use for developers.\r\n\r\n### üéà (2023) Changes to the radiation system\r\nThanks to @Semisol you will soon be able to enjoy a new radiation system which works by calculating a so-called \"exposure level\" to a radioactive substance. You won't experience radiation symptoms until a certain exposure level has been reached.\r\nThis will also make the different radiation levels much more distinct from each other and the features comes with a few good-looking UI changes too! You can track the progress of that here: https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/3189\r\n\r\n### üéà (2023) SQL database support and Research system rewrite\r\nThe Research system will be rewritten api-wise.\r\nWe will also drop numeric ids for researches and solely rely on namespaced keys.\r\nIn addition to this, we will add support for SQL databases to sync researches across multiple servers.\r\nAlternatively, a local file-based database can be used.\r\n\r\n### üîß (2023) Recipe system rewrite\r\nOur recipe system is in deep need of a rewrite, it needs to be much less item-comparison based and we should allow alternate ingredients through the use of material tags or slimefun item classes and such.\r\nI will be doing this rewrite myself and some infrastructure has been set up already but nothing to show you yet, it is still a while until we get there.\r\n\r\n### üéà (2023) Programmable androids rewrite\r\nProgrammable androids are great.\r\nBut they can be better! We will be stripping the data of an android from its block and give it a unique identity instead.\r\nThe UI will be completely redone and it will have much better performance. Oh, and you will be able to give other players access to your android and configure their permissions.\r\n\r\n### üîß (TBD) Ticker rewrite\r\nThanks to @LinoxGH and @md5sha256 our ticker system will be rewritten to be much more reliable.\r\nThis will also include some API changes that are yet to be added, you can track the progress here: https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/2996\r\n\r\n### üîß (TBD) BlockStorage system rewrite\r\nThe \"block-storage\" system will be rewritten, the API will change drastically and we will open it up for much more efficient storage methods, this will do a lot in regards to stability and performance in the long-run.\r\nYou can track the progress here: https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/2792\r\n\r\n### üîß (TBD) Changes to the config system and perhaps a reload command\r\nWe haven't fully decided on this one yet but you can follow the progress here: https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/2822\r\n\r\n### üí° (TBD) Cargo networks rewrite\r\nWhere do we even start here...

Observe how items are transferred into the destroyed Electric Furnace and are destroyed immediately afterwards as the TickerTask processes the removal of the Electric Furnace \r\n\r\nFrom my testing this is a very rare occasion, and as such a very hard bug to reproduce.\r\nHowever, with the help of a debugger which is capable of pausing the async TickerTask, it is reproducible every time\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\nThe item does not transfer, or drops in the world\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n - Minecraft Version: v1_15_R1\r\n - Slimefun Version: DEV 489 (git d8964)\r\n - CS-CoreLib Version: v1.6.3\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/1819/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/1819/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/121","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/121/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/121/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/121/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/121","id":204901222,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyMDQ5MDEyMjI=","number":121,"title":"Cargo Input Nodes don't transfer whitelisted Items if not-whitelisted items come first","user":{"login":"BlackBeltPanda","id":5866087,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NjYwODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5866087?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda","html_url":"https://github.com/BlackBeltPanda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":499484638,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0OTk0ODQ2Mzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/labels/%F0%9F%90%9E%20Bug%20Report","name":"üêû Bug Report","color":"d73f1f","default":false,"description":"A bug that needs to be fixed."},{"id":2642156940,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjQyMTU2OTQw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/labels/%F0%9F%A7%A8%20Confirmed%20Bug","name":"üß® Confirmed Bug","color":"B3EFFA","default":false,"description":"This bug has been confirmed by our team."}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":11,"created_at":"2017-02-02T15:12:02Z","updated_at":"2022-02-09T02:49:40Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"## Description\r\nWith an Input Node in Blacklist mode and no items blacklisted, connected to a chest with an Advanced Output Node with an item whitelisted, if any items are blocking the slots before the whitelisted item in the input chest with nowhere to go, the whitelisted item never gets transported.\r\n\r\n## Evidence / Proof\r\nGIF: https://i.gyazo.com/7199e6c7f7e7f173fa3c7f1dfa778efc.gif\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\nMC version: 1.11.2 (git-Paper-1032)\r\nCS-CoreLib version: 1.5.12\r\nSlimefun version: 4.1.1\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/121/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/121/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}]
